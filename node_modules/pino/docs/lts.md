## Long Term Support
<a id="lts"></a>

Pino's Long Term Support (LTS) is tied to the [Node.js LTS policy].
Major versions of Pino, "X" releases in X.Y.Z of [semantic versioning] nomenclature, will
be issued as close as possible to the release of a new major LTS release of
Node.js (subject to the Pino maintainers's capacity). Pino makes no guarantees
as to the operability of the library on unsupported releases of Node.js.

Pino will not remove support for a deprecated Node.js release via a minor,
or patch, release of Pino.
